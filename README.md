# NARRATIS: A Technological-Magical AI Framework for Narrative Analysis
## Based on "The Technological Magic of Narrative" Philosophy

---

### Quickstart: NLP Training Example

This repository now includes a small demonstration of machine learning
capabilities. The `nlp_training` folder contains a toy dataset and a
Python script for training a text classifier that distinguishes between
mathematical statements, programming snippets and general narrative
sentences.

Run the following command to train the model:

```bash
python3 nlp_training/train_classifier.py
```

The resulting model is saved as `nlp_training/model.joblib` and can be
loaded for simple text categorisation experiments.

## CONCLUSION: THE TECHNOLOGICAL MAGIC PARADIGM

The NARRATIS framework represents a paradigmatic shift from intuitive to engineered storytelling, transforming narrative creation from artistic craft to precision technology. By recognizing stories as consciousness-manipulation devices operating through linguistic ritual components, we open unprecedented possibilities for systematic narrative optimization and effect prediction.

This technological-magical approach to storytelling acknowledges the profound truth embedded in the original philosophical framework: that human consciousness responds to narrative structures according to discoverable principles, and that these principles can be systematically leveraged to create specific, predictable effects in readers and audiences.

The implications extend far beyond entertainment, touching every domain where human consciousness encounters structured information. From education to therapy, from marketing to social coordination, the principles underlying NARRATIS offer tools for more effective, ethical, and intentional consciousness engagement.

As we advance toward an age where the boundaries between technology and magic become increasingly blurred, frameworks like NARRATIS provide essential maps for navigating the landscape of augmented human experience. The future of storytelling lies not in abandoning the ancient wisdom of narrative craft, but in understanding and extending that wisdom through precise technological implementation.

The spell of the story, cast with technological precision and ethical wisdom, remains humanity's most powerful tool for consciousness transformation and collective meaning-making. NARRATIS merely provides the engineering principles for making that magic more intentional, more powerful, and more beneficial for all.

## XI. TRAINING DATA FOR MATHEMAGIC

To showcase a practical extension of the framework, this repository now includes a small dataset and training script in the `ml` directory. The dataset pairs natural language prompts with short Python code snippets. Running `python ml/train_mathemagic.py` builds a lightweight nearest‑neighbor model that retrieves an appropriate snippet for a new prompt. The resulting model is saved to a `models/` folder which is ignored by git.
